Hello. In here is all the code to operate the Dual-Axis Single Photodiode Infrared Scan Imaging System designed and built by Keaton Wright & Alan Lee. 
The code is intended to be run from Arduino IDE.
Additionally, there is a library to operate the LCD. This must be manually added to the Arduino library folder. 
All other libraries may be downloaded normally via Arduino IDE.
